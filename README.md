# hello-world
this is a hello to the world
I am a project manager for Apex Systems, a partner in the AT&T enterprise. It is a big complicated world. As long as I'm learning I'm happy and I think that I can make some positive change here. My vision is that were are a happy, efficient team buzzing with energy and life. Some may stay and some may go but the pace should be fast and the freedom should be ever-important.
